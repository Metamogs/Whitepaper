When we started with the initial idea of the Metamogs it was just a cool little idea. We then looked at many other projects and thought about what we could do to push this further into something unique using our skill sets.

We came up with the Mogaverse. Our vision is to create a Decentralized Peer-to-peer Metaverse using Unreal Engine 5 that is truly owned by you. A universe where NFT owners can Buy, Rent & Create on land ranging from a simple home to something more advanced like games. Not only this but we want every NFT collection to feel part of the Mogaverse by allowing them to buy a planet for their collection and build upon it using their own assets to create their own unique world creating a true Metaverse experience where all NFT collections can interact with each other inside the Mogaverse. 

We want to give all NFT Creators and opportunity to truly unite all NFT collections within one ever-growing world
