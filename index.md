# Our Vision

When we started with the initial idea of the Metamogs it was just a cool little idea. We then looked at many other projects and thought about what we could do to push this further into something unique using our skill sets.

We came up with the Mogaverse. Our vision is to create a Decentralized Peer-to-peer Metaverse using Unreal Engine 5 that is truly owned by you. A universe where NFT owners can Buy, Rent & Create on land ranging from a simple home to something more advanced like games. Not only this but we want every NFT collection to feel part of the Mogaverse by allowing them to buy a planet for their collection and build upon it using their own assets to create their own unique world creating a true Metaverse experience where all NFT collections can interact with each other inside the Mogaverse. 

We want to give all NFT Creators and opportunity to truly unite all NFT collections within one ever-growing world

# METAMOGS

## Introduction To The Metamogs

On a distant planet similar to earth a catastrophic event has wiped out humanity leaving only their chonky cats behind to pick up the pieces, rebuild civilization and find the answers to past events. Gathering traits from their past lives with their beloved owners, join them on their journey to becoming the Metamogs and the various adventures and characters that await them!

Metamogs is a randomly generated 3D collection of 10,000 awesome cats using Unreal Engine 5. Based on the ETH Blockchain each NFT has varying traits and rarity, and this will become your unique pass into the Mogaverse. 

**Trivia: What is a Mog?** A Mog is another word for Moggie which is a cat, especially one that does not have a pedigree.

## Metamog Companion

When creating the Metamogs concept we realised that a lot of people want to create their own character for use in the Mogaverse. We decided for our first game you would play to own a customizable companion NFT for your Metamog.
This will allow you to then switch between your companion and your Metamog allowing the best of both worlds whilst adding interesting game/world mechanics along the way.

## What is the purpose of the NFT?

This is your unique pass into the Mogaverse allowing you to visually see your Metamog brought to life in a 3D world with all their unique traits. Not only this but the initial 10,000 genesis collection will have access to unique areas, features, animations, Competition Giveaways and $CatNip multipliers to ensure that you can see we appreciate all the support you have given us!

## Metamogs Traits

Our traits are randomized by our bespoke 3D software. We input each traits rarity by percentage which the software then calculates that traits percentage and creates a render of that variant of the Metamog along with the require Metadata. This means we have no control over the final Metamogs ensuring uniqueness and rarities are fare

![Metamogs Trait Positions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103370537/162626198-51f21997-d45e-4431-ac92-a16730a851f9.jpg)

All trait variants have around 40 different types except for the personality trait which has just over 20. We want to give a nice variation but without killing the rarity at the same time. We feel this is a nice balance. 
Ranging from Hats, Swords, Grenades, Medical Masks and so much more you can be sure your Metamog will be awesome in its own way

## Breeding

We want to allow NFT holders to breed their Metamogs to add and expand the world and allow anyone who successfully breeds to sell their Newly born Metamog. This will only be allowed in specific "Breeding seasons" to ensure that it doesn't become another "gimmick"

To initiate breeding players will have pay a fee in $CatNip and will be limited to the amount of times they can breed a Metamog to ensure the market isn't flooded with premium Metamogs. 

Each Breeder will be entered into a mini bidding war where both Metamog owners will essentially bid a certain amount of $CatNip and whoever has the highest amount will be the owner of the new Metamog. The other player will then be given the opportunity to set a higher bid giving them a fair chance to win the new Metamog.

The player that has lost the bid will receive the winning bid from the other player

## Generations

Initially we will be starting with 10,000 Metamogs with Unique Perks and Multipliers

Over time we will be adding new generations of Metamogs to help grow the Mogaverse and allow more people to get on board. All holders of the original 10,000 will always get priority access to purchasing before release to the public.

We also want to ensure that owners of one of the original 10,000 still have the best perks, multipliers, access to unique areas and giveaways to make sure they feel special and appreciated. You will always have the best

## Commercial Rights

For as long as you also own one of the Metamogs 10,000 NFTS you will also own commercial rights to that Mog! Meaning you could create a special cat food with your Metamog on the label the possibilities are limitless. This means you could essentially create a multimillion $ business using your Metamog and then sell that business on when you sell your NFT which will increase the value of the NFT and really helps the Mogaverse thrive. We only ask that the Metamogs / Mogaverse have full rein to use your NFTs appearance in our Metaverse if we feel the need too.

## What if I don’t own a Metamog?

Later down the line we will then introduce generic Metamogs that can be used to access the Mogaverse. They will still look cool but won’t have access to perks, areas, and other cool stuff that the original 10,000 Mogs supporters have! This is to ensure loyalty is rewarded

## How do perks work?

The detailed information will be released closer to the release of $CatNip. Each owner of the original 10,000 NFT collection will get in game perks like but not limited to access to unique areas, airdrops and multipliers based on various things like rarity, how many NFTS owned, time spent in the Mogaverse among other cool little things

We will be introducing more collections along the way that will have perks but will not be as highly rewarded as the original collection

## How do giveaways work?

In order to take part in the giveaways you must own one of the 10,000 original Metamogs. As we scale up the Metamogs we will be introducing more collections, but these won't have the same perks or giveaways ensuring the original collection has something unique and special.

# MOGAVERSE

## What is the Mogaverse?

The Mogaverse is our take on the Metaverse. We want to create a world that feels alive by taking elements of MMORPGS and the uniqueness of the Metaverse and putting them together to create something amazing!

Your Metamogs NFT will gain you access to the Mogaverse. Initially we will start with the 10,000 unique NFTS that will gain you access to the world.
Our first goal after NFT sales is to start by creating a unique short play to earn game where the player will gain an NFT. This NFT will be your unique character where you will be able to customize it to fit you and this will become a companion to your Metamog.

Why did we choose to do this? Well people generally like to feel an attachment to their character and having a character that can be customized to their liking allows the player to get absorbed into the world more effectively.

What about my Metamog then? Well, the Metamog will be your companion throughout the world, helping you navigate, learn, and interact all whilst being cute! We are aware though that some people may want to play as their Metamog so the player will be allowed to switch between controlling your Unique character and the Metamog at their will!

The Metamog team has the advantage over other NFT/Metaverse projects in that we have experience in creating both small and large game projects. So, what does that mean? We know the reality and time frames of creating a project this large and how we should structure all the projects related to the Mogaverse in an efficient and effective way.

## Will I need an NFT to enter the Mogaverse?

No, you will be able to enter the Mogaverse without any specific purchasable NFT but will not have any of the rewards and perks of owning of the original 10,000 collection.

## Project Galactica

When thinking about a Metaverse one of the first things people generally think of is being able to interact with others on a huge scale. That could be your best friend, a family member, or a stranger! One of the issues we’ve seen with a lot of Metaverse projects is they are limited to their NFT collections meaning you are instantly limiting interaction in their Metaverse.

This is where Project Galactica comes in.

![Project Galactica](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103370537/162626233-894fa438-93d1-4988-b973-cc3a8253d132.jpg)

When thinking about the Mogaverse we came up with the idea of creating a planet that the Metamogs can all Play, Own & Build on land and create interactive experiences such as mini games among many other things all built off of Unreal Engine 5. This then progressed into “well that’s nothing new really plenty of people are creating a world like that so what can we do that’s new and encourages full blown interaction across different NFTS?”

With Project Galactica we ended up with what we feel is a cool unique idea. Other NFT projects such as BAYC, Lazy Lions etc will be able to purchase a planet and build their own world for their own NFT communities. So, what does this mean?

![Project Galactica](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103370537/162626245-ae2b79c9-b342-44ea-ad48-cca1119ba97b.jpg)

**As Example We Will Use BAYC:**
- The BAYC will be able to buy a planet
- They will be able to create their traits themselves and import them into Project Galactica
- They will be able to build their own world as they see fit
- They will be able to create their own economies within their planet
- They will be able to then create their own trade economies with other planets meaning that BAYC could setup a trading route with the Metamogs
- Any NFT will be able to visit any planet which means a Metamog could go and visit the BAYC planet

We understand how complex this is to achieve and want to be clear that this is our end goal for the Mogaverse. We believe by breaking the project down and thinking logically & using our expertise that this is very achievable to do but don’t expect this to be completed in a few months!

## Star Engine

Star Engine is an in-house project that’s being built from the ground up. This will be the backbones of our Creation tools all powered by Unreal Engine 5. A fully interactive easy to use builder will be built on top of Unreal Engine 5’s core systems meaning you have a powerful tool set at your hands but will be simple enough that anyone can create their own presence in the Mogaverse.

![star Engine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103370537/162626788-1da2df20-d143-425e-8c0c-3ad9993ebab1.jpg)

With Star Engine you will be able to upload your own meshes into the Mogaverse which is all funded by the $CatNip Token. The more $CatNip you spend the more you can upload (within reason of course!) But don’t worry you will also have a library of core modular assets to easily create something without having to know 3D Modelling. The reason you need $CatNip for uploading custom assets is to ensure that the Mogaverse isn’t full of unused assets which could cause kitty chaos!

What makes this unique though is you upload your own meshes but they must use a set texture set for the Biome you purchase your land in. This means no building huge metal skyscrapers in a fantasy forest! It must fit within the aesthetic of the world to ensure it feels and looks right when people are experiencing it for the first time.

On top of land building Star Engine will be used to create games within the Mogaverse. Think Roblox but In the Mogaverse. You will be able to create low code gaming experiences for everyone to play, Earn and Monetize to really add to the world and feel part of everything to everyone.

When designing Star Engine we wanted to make it special in that it was simple enough for Mogaverse creators with no experience to use and create something awesome but can be complex enough that experienced people can go wild!

## Biomes

Through out the Metamogs world and the Mogaverse we want to include unique Biomes to offer a piece of the world for everyone. This could include deserts, snowy mountains, forests, urban the list goes on!

When thinking about this one issue we saw in other Metaverse projects was that within each biome often Landowners were building stuff that just didn’t fit within that biome, this instantly kills the feeling of being in a forest if there is a giant skyscraper sat among the trees.

![Biomes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103370537/162626780-463a7471-d553-4340-9474-12fc8ed38fee.jpg)

Using Star Engine we want to allow people to create their own buildings using assets and texture sets that fit within that Biome. So, if you’re in a city for instance your buildings will have to fit within the city so you can’t put a tree house in among say loads of office blocks. 

When creating your own assets your will be required to make sure your structures fit within the feel of each biome.

We feel that this will keep the player engaged in the feeling of the world!

## Land

A Piece of land is essentially a tokenized piece of the Mogaverse. Whether this be a piece of land or a huge planet it is treated the same way. The owners will be able to keep the land and build upon it themselves or rent it out to others allowing for a huge range of possibilities with minimal restrictions. You will be able to build upon your land using various generic assets provided by the Metamogs team as well as being able to integrate your own at the cost of $CatNip or purchase unique assets from our marketplace ensuring the creative possibilities are limitless.

When we decide to start selling plots our 10,000 NFT owners will get first choice on plots of land at a discounted rate. After a certain period of time (announced closer to the time) we will the release this to the public, but we want to ensure that our Metamogs come first.

# GAMES

## Initial Games

We have 2 games planned out (In no particular order of release):

Our first is a 3D experience where players will get to see their Metamog bought to life inside Unreal Engine 5. We plan for this game to introduce you to your Metamog, Explain some of the back story and the world and then to work your way towards getting your first NFT which will be your companion to your Metamog.

We feel this would be a nice way to introduce players to the World and their Metamogs 

Our second game we are planning is a mobile experience where the player will be able to interact on a day-to-day basis with their Metamog to gain Airdrops and $CatNip based on how many days in a row you say hi to your Metamog... Nobody wants a lonely Chonk!

With both these games this will help us ensure we have a good solid team and allow us to get some of the core mechanics together for future games and goals such as the overall Mogaverse

## How will these games be achieved?

So, your probably thinking that "great you're going to make 2 games but it's really not that easy so how are you going to do this?"

Well firstly we are very aware that this is not an easy feat, especially without a huge team to pull it off. So that's why we decided to start with these 2 games. 

Our goal with the 3D game is to make a fun little experience where the play can see their Metamog in action whilst doing puzzles, combat, world building and interjecting story into it. Our main issue was we wanted to make this feel as fresh as possible if a person decides to replay it. So, we decided on the below

We will break down the game into essentially square tiles that will hold what we will refer to as "Rooms". Now this room can be an interior or an exterior setting, can contain buildings or foliage its only really limited via out creative ability and project vision.

What will the happen is when the game is run it will piece together a large selection of these "Rooms" to procedurally generate a level. This means that each time the game is started the layout will change, enemy placement will change and so will puzzles and pickups. As you can imagine this can instantly create almost endless playability and for us it allows us to scale up the project faster, adjust areas easily and makes bug management a lot more efficient.

For the mobile game we feel the scope of this will be far easier to manage as we won't be relying on loads of unique areas and gameplay mechanics as we see it as more of a companion app to your Metamog

## Future Games

With regards to future games, we plan on allowing games to be created via Star Engine meaning anyone with a little learning will be able to create their own games and monetize them as they feel. 

We are also looking at allowing developers outside of the Mogaverse to link in their games in allowing developers to get their games to more people and players in the Mogaverse will have a vast selection of games at their paws.

Not only that as the Metamogs team scales we will also introduce more games and experiences made by us. We have a few cool ideas that will be discussed and introduced to the community when we get closer to development.

These will including single player, standard multiplayer games, and community driven games

## Supported Systems

Initially we will be support PC as our primary platform. We plan on the developing Mac, Mobile and console versions in the future. It's in our interest to offer games and the Mogaverse across as many devices and platforms as we can but we don't want to do that at the expense of quality.

We are also actively looking at VR development and will be something we will look at in the future as VR tech improves and catches up to the demands of modern-day gaming

# Development Transparency

With a lot of these projects the community are left in the dark and are told constantly "it's coming" but realistically they don't have a clue how far off it is.

The first thing we will do when we start development of any project will be create a full roadmap of that project with realistic goals and time frames that anyone can look at and see where the team are in development.

We will also hold regular developer logs and AMAs where we will explain what's been going on and give you chance to ask your Game/Mogaverse related questions.

This helps people trust the project and feel part of what is happening. We want to apply this thinking across the whole of the Metamogs and Mogaverse.

# $CatNip Token

Currently our goal is to focus on the Metamogs Launch and to ensure the success of it before encouraging people in purchase $CatNip. Our first target is our little mini game experience where the player will gain an NFT reward companion for their Metamog. 

When we feel it's time to launch $CatNip will we ensure we have detailed explanations of how the eco system will work so you gain a full understanding of everything.

We just feel it's not right to be pushing other things to buy when our initial NFT collection is yet to be released.

We will how ever give a small, brief in-site into how we currently foresee $CatNip working. $CatNip will be the in key in game currency of the Mogaverse. You must own this to purchase from in game marketplaces, add your own unique assets to your Mogaverse land as well as giving back to our Metamogs by giving multipliers and perks using $CatNip.

This may change and evolve but these are some of our core principles that we want to bring along with $CatNip. Any questions relating to this please do feel free to ask us and we will be more than happy to explain.

# DAO Governance

This goes hand in hand with the $CatNip token. We will be releasing more information on this when we are closer to releasing the $CatNip token.

We want to assure you that if you own one of the 10,000 you will be able to have input along the way too. We want everyone to be involved as its this is OUR project... Yours & Ours, we are a team

# Team

The Metamogs team consists of mainly talent from the Game/3D industry currently and we plan on expanding this after the initial sale of the first 10,000 collection.

We have vast knowledge in game creation, 3d art, sound, programming and so much more which means that we do have a realistic idea of how to take on game projects and the time they will take meaning it won't be the usual "Unreal Engine Quixel Megascan's assets with trailers that never actually show anything else" type project.

# Technology

### Game Engine

Mogaverse is built from the ground up using Unreal Engine 5. The core foundations and games created for the Mogaverse are built using a combination of C++ & Blueprints to ensure efficient, speedy delivery of projects. We chose Unreal Engine 5, like many, for its ability to handle huge projects effectively as there’s nothing worse than trying to constantly battle a game engine when creating.

### The Metamogs Planet

Each part of the Metamogs planet will be built from the ground up using various technologies and of course the skills of highly creative 3D artists! With a blend of old school 3D artists and procedural technologies this will allow us to create huge areas quickly and then have each area feel tailor made. As each area is built, we want to release parts of it for the community to test and engage with allowing you to be part of the creation of our home!

### The Backend Stuff

Our end goal is to have that game running Peer-To-Peer with the only requirements outside of the Mogaverse is to interact with your wallet when needed. Now this kind of task is a huge undertaking and will require a lot of rewrites of parts of the unreal engine as well as technology catching up among other things.

So initially we want to do it the traditional way with software's and services such as AWS (Amazon Web Services) using their Lambda serverless model which allows us to scale the project up to essentially unlimited possibilities whilst keeping it as cost effective as possible. Using AWS also allows to use their top-class monitoring and security services as well as many other unique features to allow us to create & scale without limitation. 

### Blockchain

The Mogaverse uses NFT & Blockchain technology to allow our owners, community & participants to be self-sovereign within our world. NFTs allow full digital property ownership on the internet as well as commercial rights outside. Each of the Metamogs NFTs are unique and randomly generated to ensure what you are getting is truly a distinct 1 of 1.
